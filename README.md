# VACHAK-CHATBOT

The Real-Time AI Chatbot is a well-structured web application designed to provide users with seamless, intelligent, and interactive conversational experiences. The chatbot is developed using Vite and React.js for optimal frontend performance, while WebSockets and RESTful APIs facilitate real-time communication and data retrieval.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
